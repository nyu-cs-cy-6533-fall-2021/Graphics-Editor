# 3D Scene Editor

## Scene Editor

Implement an interactive application that allows to add, edit, and delete 3D meshes. The scene should always contain at least one light source. New objects can be added to the scene in three ways:

* The key '1' will add a unit cube in the origin

* The key '2' will import a new copy of the mesh 'bumpy_cube.off', scale it to fit into a unit cube and center it on the origin

* The key '3' will import a new copy the mesh 'bunny.off', scale it to fit into a unit cube and center it on the origin

Note that you can have multiple copies of the same object in the scene, and each copy can have its own position, scale, and rotation.

For this exercise, all transformations MUST be done in the shader. The VBO containing the vertex positions of each object should be uploaded only once to the GPU. 

## Object Control

Clicking on a object will select the object, changing its color. When an object is selected, it should be possible to translate it, rotate it around its barycenter, and rescale it without changing its barycenter. All these actions should be associated to keyboard keys (and the choice of keys should be detailed in the readme).

Each object also has a rendering setting associated with it, which can be one of the following three options:

* Wireframe: only the edges of the triangles are drawn

* Flat Shading: each triangle is rendered using a unique color (i.e. the normal of all the fragments that compose a triangle is simply the normal of the plane that contains it). On top of the flat shaded triangle, you should draw the wireframe.

* Phong Shading: the normals are specified on the vertices of the mesh and interpolated in the interior. The lighting equation should be evaluated for each fragment.

To compute the per-vertex normals you should first compute the per-face normals, and then average them on the neighboring vertices. In other words, the normal of the vertex of a mesh should be the average of the normals of the faces touching it. Remember to normalize the normals after averaging.

When an object is selected, it must be possible to switch between the different rendering modes by pressing three keys on the keyboard.

## Camera Control

Add the possibility to translate the position of the camera (similarly to the previous assignment), but in this exercise the camera should always *point to the origin*. It should be possible to move it around, but the camera should always face the origin.

Implement both a *orthographic camera* (similar to the one that you used for Assignment 2, but in 3D) and a *perspective camera*. The cameras should take into account the size of the window, properly adapting the aspect ratio to not distort the image whenever the window is resized. All functionalities should work after resizing the window, including object selection and editing of the scene.

## Optional Tasks

These tasks are optional. Each task worth 4% of the final grade.

## Trackball

Use a trackball to control the camera. This can be achieved restricting the movement of the camera on a sphere centered on the origin. The easiest way to do it is to parametrize the sphere using spherical coordinates, and to assign keyboard keys to move the camera on the sphere. The camera should always look at the origin.


## Shadow Mapping

Starting with the interactive application you have implemented in the previous assignment, add shadows to the scene to increase its realism. You will still need to be able to add, select and move, and delete 3D meshes to the scene (they can be added in randomly at any position in the scene; otherwise, the center of the scene).

The scene should always contain one light source (you can add more light sources if you want, but that will require multiple depth maps). The light source should be placed on top of the scene and move around the scene's objects in a circular path (imagine you are in the center of a room, and the light source moves around you at the top of your head).

New objects can be added to the scene in three ways:

* The key '1' will add a unit cube in the origin

* The key '2' will import a new copy of the mesh 'bumpy_cube.off', scale it to fit into a unit cube and center it on the origin

* The key '3' will import a new copy the mesh 'bunny.off', scale it to fit into a unit cube and center it on the origin

Note that you can have multiple copies of the same object in the scene, and each copy can have its position, scale, and rotation. All objects (besides the reflective ones) must be shaded using the Phong Shading (per-fragment shading) and Phong's lighting model.

The shadow's color must interchangeably change colors from back to red and vice-versa when the user hits the key 's' (see figures below).  In order to easily visualize the shadows, you must render a plane below the objects in the scene (see figure below).

Don't forget to consult the class textbook and the optional and recommended text. The OpenGL Programming Guide has a full section on shadow mapping. It is explained in detail how to set up the depth buffer for using a shadow mapping algorithm and the matrices transformations needed.

## Environment Mapping

In this task, you must implement the environment mapping technique discussed in class.
Using the cube map textures provided in the data folder into the assignment directory in GitHub, you must create the cube skybox and correctly load the textures in OpenGL (remember the axis directions). 

You can convert the images to an image format you already can handle (PPM) (for instance, using GIMP) or use any other image library to load the data from the disk. In the case you use an external library, you must provide the code for the library, the changes in the CMake configurations, and be sure it compiles on Linux with no issues.

The easiest way to accomplish this task is to start adding the skybox cube, validating that you correctly loaded the cube map textures, and then write the vertex and fragment shaders to handle the reflection direction calculation and texture sampling.

When an object is selected, it should be possible to translate it, rotate it around its barycenter, and rescale it without changing its barycenter. All these actions should be associated to keyboard keys (and the choice of keys should be detailed in the readme).

Each object also has a rendering setting associated with it, which can be one of the following two options:

* Phong Shading: the normals are specified on the vertices of the mesh and interpolated in the interior. The lighting equation should be evaluated for each fragment.

* Mirror (chrome) appearance: the object is rendered using the environment mapping technique discussed in class. In this item, you don't need to update the cube map texture at each iteration.

## Camera Control

Add the possibility to translate the position of the camera (similarly to the previous assignment). The camera should always point to the origin. It should be possible to move it around, but the camera should always face the origin.

Implement only the perspective camera. The cameras should take into account the size of the window, properly adapting the aspect ratio to not distort the image whenever the window is resized. All functionalities should work after resizing the window, including object selection and editing of the scene.

## Refraction

This task is optional and worth 1% of the final grade.
The calculation of the reflection vector can be easily changed to the calculation of the refraction vector. 
Add to your system the refractive material property for the objects. Once it is implemented, you will be able to render transparent objects.
